# Contributing

As the community documentation is for the users, we love the contributions from the users.


## Preliminary operations

* If not already done, have a look at [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) and [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax. The documentation is based on this tool and language
* If not already done, install MkDocs or use the provided builder-env based on docker containers
* Browse the [community documentation](http://community.openfluid-project.org) to get familiar with the documentation structure.
