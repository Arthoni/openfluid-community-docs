Starting with version 2.1.0, OpenFLUID provides its own development environment named OpenFLUID-DevStudio.  
This environment is automatically installed with OpenFLUID versions 2.1.0 and later. It provides a complete graphical environment for easily develop and build simulators, observers and builder-extensions.  
From now, the DevStudio environment is the recommended environment.  
<br/>

However, to be fully functional this environment relies on external tools:

* CMake for configuration of builds
* Gcc as the C++/C/Fortran compiler
* LaTeX for automatic documentation (optional)

Following the [OpenFLUID installation instructions](../start/install.md), these tools are installed by default for [Linux](../start/install.md#linux) and [MacOS](../start/install.md#macos) users, but  require additional install operations for [Windows](../start/install.md#windows) users.
