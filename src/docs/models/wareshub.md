## Overview

OpenFLUID-WaresHub is a deployable system to provide online services for capitalization, follow-up and sharing of models.  

This system proposes features for each hosted simulator, observer and builder-extension:

* source code management (git)
* issue tracker (bugs, Ã©volutions, review)
* access rights management
* associated documentation
* meta-information: license, contributor(s), contact(s), ...

OpenFLUID-WaresHub is made of a management system of git repositories, webservices and web interface. It can be deployed for various collaborative working purposes : projects, workgroups, research units, company, ...  
The OpenFLUID-DevStudio application allows to directly connect to an OpenFLUID-WaresHub repository to facilitate development, follow-up and sharing of simulators, observers, and extensions for OpenFLUID-Builder.

An example of an OpenFLUID-WaresHub instance is the models repository of LISAH research unit, which can be accessed at
